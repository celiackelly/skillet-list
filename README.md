**Skillet List** is a tool for creative cooks who love trying new recipes.  
 - Add recipes to your Skillet List, tag them by meal, and link to the recipe source. 
 - Come back often for inspiration as you plan your meals. What will you cross off your Skillet List this week? 
 - Once you've cooked a recipe, check it off your Skillet List and save it in your Recipe Box. 
  
## How It's Made:

Skillet List is a full-stack application built with **Node.js, Express, MongoDB**.

## Next Steps:

[] Change background colors of meal badges to differentiate them easily. 
[] Add recipe rating and notes features.
