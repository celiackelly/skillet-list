**Skillet List** is a tool for creative cooks who love trying new recipes.  
 - Add recipes to your Skillet List, tag them by meal, and link to the recipe source. 
 - Come back often for inspiration as you plan your meals. What will you cross off your Skillet List this week? 
 - Once you've cooked a recipe, cross it off your Skillet List and save it in your Recipe Box. 
  
## How It's Made:

Skillet List is a full-stack application built with **Node.js, Express, MongoDB**. 

It uses **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)** as its view engine. 

It also uses the **Bootstrap** CSS framework. 

## Lessons Learned:


## Optimizations: 

 

## Next Steps:
[] Implement login functionality.
[] Add additional url validation to ensure that users can input recipe links without the http or https scheme (e.g. www.foodnetwork.com) and have them work as expected.
[] Change background colors of meal badges to differentiate them easily. 
[] Add recipe rating and notes features.
